                <h3>Visual Hierachy and Alignment</h3>
                <h4>Porsche</h4>
                <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/">Porsche USA</a>

            <p>
                Porsche's website is great on mobile. It really shows visual hierachy and alignment. It is appealing to the eye, 
                especially because the first thing you see are the cars. Also the alignment is great because the pictures are not 
                 all over the place and the layout is in the right order.

                <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
                <h4>Amazon</h4>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
            </article>
            <img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="amazon's website">
            <p>
                Amazon's website uses Hick's law pretty well. Since it is one of the biggest websites to shop on for practically 
                anything we want. There is so much to choose from and because of that, they do a great at using filters. These 
                help us know how to find exactly the right product we want.

                <h3>Contrast</h3>
                <h4>ABC</h4>
                <a href="https://abc.com/">ABC</a>
            </article>
            <img src="images/abc.jpg" alt="abc's website">
            <p>
                ABC does a great job when it comes to contrast. It is visually appealing to the eye. Everything blends really 
                well together because of the colors that are used. Not only that, our eyes don't hurt looking at it either.
